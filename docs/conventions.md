### Includes
- Angle brackets <> when including from libraries.
- Quotations "" when including internal files.
- Use relative paths when it makes sense for files to be in the same directory (or child directories). If you need to include a file from a parent folder, it is almost always in a different "module" of the project and should be included as an "absolute" path (relative to src). `"util/fastMath.h"` instead of `"../../util/fastMath.h"`.
